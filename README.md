# AJAX Chat <-> IRC proxy bot

Developed to bring FPV-Community.de AJAX chat into IRC. Should work with any [Blueimp's AJAX Chat](https://frug.github.io/AJAX-Chat/) instance and any IRC server.

Requires [Python Requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/).

Rename `config.sample.py` to `config.py` and set your IRC bot nickserv password, then run `python ircbot.py`.

Feel free to fork and submit pull requests for any desired features or enhancements.
